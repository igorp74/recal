# Rust Event Calendar

## 💡 The Idea
Once upon a time, I was using [UK's Kalender](https://www.ukrebs-software.de) by Ulrich Krebs and [Calendar](https://www.horstmuc.de/wrem.htm#calendar) application by Horst Schaeffer. Then along came the Google Calendar, Quip, Notion and similar online apps/services... Nowadays, I tend to go minimal, fast and efficient, thus command line... Since I am working on Linux (private) and Windows (business) I tend to have my set of portable utilities with me, so I can have the same apps accross these environemnts. Windows do not have decent calendar for CLI, so I get it on and made one. Golang and Rust rise to be very useful and handy as tools for crafting command line apps, so I started with Golang and decided to do similar in Rust (this calendar) just to experience the difference. The code itself is of the similar length, but compiled binaries are far lighter with Rust.
